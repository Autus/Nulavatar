# Nulavatar
Adds dynamic avatars to your forums!

This is the old Nulavatar modification made for PHPBB 2. I've uploaded it here because I've made a few simple changes to it. It *should* work for anyone who wants to install it on a vanilla board. This version **IS** compatible with EasyMod 0.4.0.

For simplicity's sake, I've dubbed this edited version as Nulavatar 1.3.2.
