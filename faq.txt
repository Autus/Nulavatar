I'll write up a decent Guide/FAQ soon.

If you're having problems and cannot find the answer in this FAQ, please post your problem in
the NulAvatar thread located here: http://www.mods.best-dev.com/viewtopic.php?t=1262
Make sure to include any error message(s) you recieve (if any)!

Here are the most common questions/problems:

Q: Can I add more images?
A: Yes! Just upload your images to /images/nulavatar/ and make sure they're in PNG format. You
   can then add them by using Edit Images in the NulAvatar Admin Panels.

Q: When one of my users tries to save his/her Avatar, he/she gets an error!
Q: The Avatars aren't being saved!
A: Make sure your images/nulavatar_avatars/ folder is CHMODded to 777.

Q: I want to have people pay to use certain images, is that possible?
A: Yes. If you have the Shop MOD or ADR installed you can specify an item users need to have in
   their inventory before they can select certain image. You can do this by filling in the
   item's name in the Item Needed box of the images you want people to have an item for!

Q: Whever I click any link/button, the page just refreshes and nothing happens?
A: Are you using phpBB 2.0.9+? If so, go here for a fix:
